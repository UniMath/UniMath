Installation of UniMath on Unix-like systems
============================================

## Remarks

- This file describes the default method for installing UniMath.  An alternative method using the [Nix Package Manager](https://nixos.org/nix/) is available in the file [INSTALL\_NIX.md](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL_NIX.md).
- A sketch for getting UniMath to run on Windows is given at [INSTALL\_WIN.md](./INSTALL_WIN.md).

## Preparing your computer

In this section, we explain how to prepare your computer for the compilation of
UniMath under [Mac OS X](#preparing-for-the-installation-under-mac-os-x),
under [Ubuntu/Debian](#preparing-for-the-installation-under-ubuntu-or-debian-linux),
and under [Arch/Manjaro Linux](#preparing-for-the-installation-under-arch-linux-or-manjaro-linux).

### Preparing for the installation under Mac OS X

NB: The following is a recommended simple approach.
For more customisation of your installation, see [INSTALL\_OPAM.md](./INSTALL_OPAM.md).

1. Install OCaml and required libraries, using your preferred package manager.  E.g. using Homebrew (http://brew.sh/), issue the command:
```bash
$ brew install ocaml opam ocaml-num ocaml-findlib
```
2. If later in the installation you get a message asking for a specific OCaml version, and/or installing extra packages, you can do this with:
```bash
$ opam init
$ eval $(opam env)
$ opam switch create 4.11.0
$ opam install num ocamlfind
```
This should prepare your system for [Installing UniMath](#installing-unimath) below.

You will also need an editor.  There are several options:

1. We recommend Emacs with Proof General.  A classic Emacs can be installed from https://emacsformacosx.com/; alternatively, Aquamacs (https://aquamacs.org) provides a slightly more native interface, with standard Mac OS keybindings.  Instructions for [installation of Proof General](#installation-of-proofgeneral-all-operating-systems) are below.  

2. A popular newer option is Visual Studio Code, available from https://code.visualstudio.com, with the VSCoq extension.

3. Alternatively, you can use Coqâ€™s own CoqIDE.  For this you will need LablGtk3 and LablGtkSourceView3; these can be installed with:
```bash
$ brew install lablgtk gtksourceview3
$ opam install lablgtk3 lablgtk-sourceview3
```
With those installed, follow the instructions in [INSTALL\_COQIDE.md](./INSTALL_COQIDE.md).

### Preparing for the installation under Ubuntu or Debian (Linux)

Under Ubuntu or Debian, you may install ocaml with the
following shell command.

```bash
 sudo apt-get install build-essential git ocaml ocaml-nox ocaml-native-compilers camlp5 libgtk2.0 libgtksourceview2.0 liblablgtk-extras-ocaml-dev ocaml-findlib libnum-ocaml-dev emacs
```
Now proceed with [Installation of Proof General](#installation-of-proofgeneral-all-operating-systems) and [Installing UniMath](#installing-unimath) below.

### Preparing for the installation under Arch Linux or Manjaro Linux

Under Arch Linux or Manjaro Linux you may install ocaml and Emacs  with the following
shell commands.

```bash
 sudo pacman --sync --needed archlinux-keyring
 sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
 sudo pacman --sync --needed ocaml camlp5 ocaml-findlib ocaml-num
 sudo pacman -S emacs
```
Now proceed with [Installation of Proof General](#installation-of-proofgeneral-all-operating-systems) and [Installing UniMath](#installing-unimath) below.

## Installation of Proof General (all operating systems)

You may obtain Proof General from by using the quick installation instructions
at http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/ or at https://proofgeneral.github.io/.
Your version of emacs determines which version of Proof General you need,
roughly, so some experimentation may be required; you may even need the current
development version if your emacs is recent.

For those unfamiliar with Emacs, `M-x` means "hold Alt, press x".

Similarly, `C-g` means "hold Ctrl, press g". This cancels any action you have
started.

Finally, `RET` means "press Enter".

Hence, the first Proof General installation instruction
```
M-x package-refresh-contents RET
```
reads "hold Alt, press x; type package-refresh-contents; press Enter".

Optional: some useful Proof General add-ons are available for installation at
https://github.com/cpitclaudel/company-coq/.

## Installing UniMath

To download UniMath, issue the following shell commands.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath
$ cd UniMath
```

To compile the Coq formalizations (in all the packages), issue the following
shell command (in this directory).

```bash
$ make
```

Once this is done, you can start [browsing and editing UniMath](./USAGE.md).
Below, we explain how to compile individual packages of UniMath, and how to
create HTML documentation.

### Building individual packages and HTML documentation

- To compile an individual package and the files it depends on, e.g., the package `CategoryTheory`, issue
   ```bash
   $ make CategoryTheory
   ```

- To compile an individual file and the files it depends on, e.g., the file `CategoryTheory/Categories.v`, issue
   ```bash
   $ make UniMath/CategoryTheory/Categories.vo
   ```
   Note the extension `*.vo` required in the command.

- To create the standard HTML documentation provided by coqdoc:
   ```bash
   $ make html
   ```
   The documentation is created in the subdirectory ```html```.

- To create HTML documentation with "hidden" proofs:
   ```bash
   $ make doc
   ```
   In this version of the documentation, any proof enclosed within ```Proof.``` and ```Qed.```/```Defined.``` is replaced by a button ```Show proof.```.
   Clicking on this button unveils (unfolds) the corresponding proof. A ```Hide proof``` button can be used to fold the proof again.
   The documentation is created in the subdirectory ```enhanced-html```.
   (This feature requires the use of the otherwise optional ```Proof``` command of
   the Coq vernacular language to indicate the beginning of the proof.  Toggling
   of proofs requires an internet connection for downloading the ```jquery```
   library.)

- To install UniMath in the ```user-contrib``` directory of Coq, for use by other developments:
   ```bash
   $ make install
   ```
   The path to that directory from here, by default, is ./sub/coq/user-contrib/.

- To install [CoqIDE](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/practical-tools/coqide.html), see [INSTALL\_COQIDE](./INSTALL_COQIDE.md).

## TAGS files

Emacs (which every UniMath user should become expert with) includes a facility
called "tags" which enables easy navigation between Coq proof files.  For
example, you may be examining a proof containing a reference to a symbol such
as "has_homsets", and you may wonder where the source code of its definition
is.  To do that, one positions the cursor on the symbol, presses ```M-.```,
accepts (or modifies) the proffered string, and presses return.  Emacs then
takes you to the source code of the definition.  One may repeat that as often
as desired, and return one level upward in the chain of locations visited with
```M-*```.

In order to enable this facility, make a "TAGS" file as follows.
To make a TAGS file for use with emacs ```etags``` commands:
```bash
$ make TAGS
```
To make a TAGS file dealing with a single package, for example, ```Foundations```:
```bash
$ make TAGS-Foundations
```

The first time the tags facility is used, the user will be prompted for the
location of a TAGS file to use -- it will be in the top-level directory of
UniMath.

## Measuring compilation time

To obtain information about the compilation time of each file, add
```TIMED=yes``` to the ```make``` command line.  For this to work, you need the
GNU ```time``` utility installed on your system in ```/usr/bin```.  Alternatively,
add ```TIMECMD=time``` to the ```make``` command line, where ```time``` is a
time command that works on your system.

On both Linux and Mac OS X systems, ```time``` is a built in bash shell command
that differs from GNU time, available on Linux systems as ```\time```.  Under
Mac OS X, you can install GNU time as ```gtime``` by running ```brew install
gnu-time```.

Since ```make``` variables can be included in the time command, the following
example (using GNU time ```gtime```) shows how to display the user time and the name of the
file on the same line.
```
$ time make TIMECMD='gtime -f "user time %U: $*"'
```
The first ```time``` command provides overall time for the whole build.

Timing of execution of individual tactics and vernacular commands can be obtained by
```bash
$ make MOREFLAGS=-time
```
For postprocessing of the (huge) output, use our utility ```slowest```, like this:
```bash
$ make MOREFLAGS=-time TIMECMD='util/slowest 10 0.5'
```
For each Coq file compiled, the timing of the 10 slowest steps taking at least
0.5 seconds will be displayed.

You may time both steps and files like this:
```bash
$ make MOREFLAGS=-time TIMECMD='gtime -f "user time %U: $(basename $*)" util/slowest 10 0.5'
```

To speed up execution on a machine with multiple cores or pseudo-cores, specify
the use of multiple processes in paralle, e.g, 4, as follows.
```
$ make -j4
```

## Further details

The correct version of Coq is built and used automatically by the command
```make```.  (If you wish to bypass the building of Coq and use your own version,
then follow the instructions in the file build/Makefile-configuration-template.)

The file ```UniMath/.dir-locals.el``` contains code that arranges for
Proof General to use the Coq programs built by ```make``` when one of the proof
files of UniMath is opened in emacs; in order to use them more generally, such
as from the command line,, then add the full path for the directory
```./sub/coq/bin``` to your ```PATH``` environment variable, or set the emacs
variable ```coq-prog-name``` in your emacs initialization file, ```.emacs```.

The various *.v files are compiled by Coq in such a way that the fully
qualified name of each identifier begins with UniMath.  For example, the fully
qualified name of ```maponpaths``` in uu0.v is ```UniMath.Foundations.Basics.PartA.maponpaths```.

The preferred way to interact with the Coq code is with Proof General, running
in a modern version of emacs.  The file UniMath/.dir-locals.el will set the
emacs variable ```coq-prog-args``` appropriately.  In particular, it will add the
directory UniMath to the path, using the ```-R``` option, and it will arrange for
files with names of the form ```*.v``` to be edited in "Coq mode".

We are using some unicode characters in our Coq files.  One way to type such
characters easily is with the "Agda input method": to type Ïƒ, for example, one
types \sigma, which is automatically replaced by Ïƒ.  We have arranged for the
Agda input method to be automatically enabled in buffers containing one of the
UniMath Coq files.  The emacs command for viewing the typing shortcuts offered
by the Agda input method is ```C-H I```.

## Problems

In this section we describe some problems that have been encountered during compilation, and how to fix them.

### Errors while compiling Coq

The following type mismatch error during compilation of Coq results from a mismatch
between the version of Ocaml used and the version of Coq being compiled.

```
"/usr/local/bin/ocamlfind" opt -rectypes -dtypes -w -3-52-56  -I config -I lib -I kernel -I kernel/byterun -I library -I proofs -I tactics -I pretyping -I interp -I stm -I toplevel -I parsing -I printing -I intf -I engine -I ltac -I tools -I tools/coqdoc -I plugins/omega -I plugins/romega -I plugins/micromega -I plugins/quote -I plugins/setoid_ring -I plugins/extraction -I plugins/fourier -I plugins/cc -I plugins/funind -I plugins/firstorder -I plugins/derive -I plugins/rtauto -I plugins/nsatz -I plugins/syntax -I plugins/decl_mode -I plugins/btauto -I plugins/ssrmatching -I plugins/ltac -I "/usr/local/Cellar/camlp5/7.03_1/lib/ocaml/camlp5" -thread -g    -c lib/pp_control.ml
File "lib/pp_control.ml", line 61, characters 22-33:
Error: This expression has type bytes -> int -> int -> unit
       but an expression was expected of type string -> int -> int -> unit
       Type bytes is not compatible with type string 
```

For example, Coq 8.6.1 cannot be compiled by Ocaml 4.06.0, and must instead be
compiled by an older version.  In the instructions above, we arrange for Ocaml
4.02.3 to be used to compile Coq 8.6.1.

### Problems caused by ill-formed input to make

When calling ```make```, various files are read, some of them not under version control by git. 
If those files are ill-formed, ```make``` stops working; in particular, ```make``` cannot be used to delete and recreate those files.
When such a situation arises, one solution is to try cleaning everything with this command:
```bash
$ make INCLUDE=no distclean
```
Another solution is to let git do the cleaning, by running:
```bash
$ git clean -Xdfq
$ git submodule foreach git clean -Xdfq
```
The Makefile provides this pair of commands, too:
```bash
$ make INCLUDE=no git-clean
```

### Problems specific to MacOS

If you get error messages involving the command line option ```-fno-defer-pop```, you
might be running Mac OS X 10.9 with an ocaml compiler installed by ```brew```.  In
that case try

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade objective-caml
```

If that doesn't work, try

```bash
brew remove objective-caml
brew install objective-caml
```

### Problems specific to Linux (e.g., Debian and Ubuntu)

If you get the error message ```Error: cannot find 'ocamlc.opt' in your path!```, you need to install ocaml-native-compilers, e.g., by running
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ocaml-native-compilers
```
This package is not among the build dependencies for older versions of Coq.

### Hints for developers

- To regularly update the TAGS file, you may build with the command `make TAGS all`.

- Before submitting a pull request, developers should run the sanity checks that are specified
  in the Makefile by adding `sanity-checks` to the "make" command line.
  
- One of the sanity checks checks that all proof files in the directory tree
  are listed in the corresponding package, but it will complain even about
  files you haven't checked in; to disable the test, add `-o
  check-listing-of-proof-files` to the "make" command line.  Other sanity
  checks can be skipped the same way.  For example, if you intend to make a
  change to the Foundations package, then you can add `-o
  check-for-change-to-Foundations` to the "make" command line.

- Memory limits: pull requests are tested automatically by "travis" at github,
  and at that point, a memory limit is imposed to ensure reproducibility of
  results to and to prevent excessive memory usage.  To apply the same memory
  limit on your own machine before submitting a pull request, add
  `LIMIT_MEMORY=yes` to the `make` command line.  Unfortunately, under Mac OS
  X, such memory limits are ineffective, so you may prefer to run the test
  under Linux.

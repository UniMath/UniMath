 Small maps from a universe

 Universes are essential in the context of algebraic set theory where one is interested in
 making models of various flavors of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Developments of algebraic
 set theory usually proceed as follows.
 - One starts with some ambient category `C`. This category is required to satisfy several
   properties, usually that it is finitely complete, extensive, regular, and that it is a
   Heyting category.
 - This category must be equipped with a class of maps, which are called the small maps.
   If we think about small maps from the context of set theory, then we think of them as
   maps `f : x --> y` whose fibers are contained in some fixed cardinal `κ`. There are
   various axiomatizations for the class of small maps, and we discuss them below.
 - There must be a universe. Specifically, there is a morphsm `p : e --> b` such that every
   small map can be obtained as some pullback of `p`.
 - There also must be a powerclass operator, which intuitively means that for every object
   `x` we have an object `P x` that contains all small subobjects of `x` (i.e., all small
   monomorphism into `x`), and this powerclass operator must have an initial algebra.

 The final ingredient (powerclass and its initial algebra) is necessary to construct the
 collection `V` of all sets, which allows us to make models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory
 where one has unbounded quantification. However, in this file we are only interested in the
 first three ingredients.

 There are various axioms that one considers for classes of small maps. Here we list some of
 them and we give their type theoretic interpretation.
 - Every identity morphism is small. From a type theoretic perspective, this means that the
   terminal object is small.
 - The composition of small morphisms is small. From a type theoretic perspective, this means
   that small types are closed under ∑-types.
 - Every monomorphism is small. This corresponds to propositional resizing, as it says that
   the universe contains every proposition (monomorphisms correspond to propositions).
 - Small morphisms are closed under pullback. This means that small types are closed under
   substitution.
 - Small morphisms are closed under taking copairs. This means that small types are closed
   under sums.
 - Small morphisms are closed under regular epimorphisms. This means that every quotient of
   a small type again is small. Note that there is no restriction on the equivalence relation,
   which can be large.
 - The natural numbers object and the subobject classifier are small. The first means that the
   type of natural numbers is small and the second is another impredicativity axiom. More
   specifically, it says that the type of all propositions is small.
 And there are much more axioms that one might consider for classes of small maps depending on
 the context.

 In this file, we construct a class of small maps in every category with a universe. We also
 show how closure conditions of the universe gives rise to closure conditions on the class of
 small maps. The main idea is that a morphism is said to be small if there is a code in the
 universe whose associated type corresponds to that type. If we use suggestive notation, then
 we can see a morphism `π A : Γ & A --> Γ` as a type `A` in context `Γ`, and we say that `A` is
 small if there is a term `a` of the universe type in context `Γ` such that `el a` and `A` are
 isomorphic.

 It is worthwhile to notice that approaches based on small maps endow morphisms with an
 additional property. However, our development of type formers is based on operations. More
 concretely, the axiom for ∑-types in the context of small maps says that small maps are closed
 under composition, and this purely talks about property. However, our axiom for ∑-types is
 expressed via an operation on terms of the universe type with suitable stability conditions.

 To illustrate the axioms below, we compare them to "A brief introduction to algebraic set
 theory" by Awodey, and we highlight similarities and differences. Note that the axiom (U),
 which says that the powerclass has an initial algebra `V`, is not considered in this file.

     isomorphism, because small maps are some pullback of the universe. For this reason,
     we can conclude that all isomorphisms are small.

     Proposition 2.5 in "Elementary axioms for categories of classes" by Simpson), and that
     the subobject classifier is small. Note that here one needs that all monomorphisms are
     small. The following statement expresses the smallness of the subobject classifier.

     If the ambient category is locally Cartesian closed, then powerclasses can be constructed

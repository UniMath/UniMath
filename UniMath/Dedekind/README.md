Dedekind
===============

Authors: Catherine Lelay

This Coq library provides a formalisation of real numbers built using
Dedekind cuts.

It builds upon V. Voevodsky's Foundations library, available on
http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0053.

For any question about this library, send an email to Catherine Lelay.

Univalent Mathematics Coq files
===============================

Each subdirectory of this directory consists of a separate package, with
various authors, as recorded in the README (or README.md) file in it.

## Adding a file to a package

Each package contains a subdirectory called ".package".  The file
".packages/files" consists of a list of the paths to the *.v files of the
package, in order, i.e., a file is listed after files it depends on.
(That's just so the TAGS file will be correctly sequenced.)  To add a file to a
package, add its path to that file.

## Adding a new package

Create a subdirectory of this directory, populate it with your files, add a
README (or README.md) file, and add a file .package/files, listing the *.v
files of your package, as above.  Then add the name of your package to the head
of the list assigned to "PACKAGES" in the file "./Makefile", or, alternatively,
if you'd like to test your package with modifying "./Makefile", which you might
accidentally commit and push, add its name to the head of the list in
"../build/Makefile-configuration", which is created from
"../build/Makefile-configuration-template".

## UniMath coding style

In the following rules, we purposely restrict our use of Coq to a subset whose
semantics is more likely to be rigorously verifiable and portable to new proof
checking systems, and we follow a style of coding designed to render proofs
less fragile and to make the files have a more uniform and pleasing appearance.

* Do not use `Admitted` or introduce new axioms.
* Do not use `Prop` or `Set`, and ensure definitions don't produce
  elements of them.
* Do not use `Type`, except in `Foundations/Basics/Preamble.v`.
  Use `UU` instead.  If higher universes are needed, they should be
  added to `Foundations/Basics/Preamble.v`.
* Do not use `Inductive` or `Record`, except in `Foundations/Basics/Preamble.v`.
* Do not use `Module` or `Structure`.
* Do not use `Fixpoint`.
* Do not use `destruct`, `match`, `case`, square brackets with `intros`, or
  nested square brackets with `induction`.  (The goal is to prevent generation of
  proof terms using `match`.)
* Use `do` with a specific numerical count, rather than `repeat`, to make proofs
  easier to repair.
* Use `as` to name all new variables introduced by `induction` or
  `destruct`, if the corresponding type is defined in a remote location,
  because different names might be used by Coq when the definition of the type
  is changed.  Name all variables introduced by `assert`, if they are used by
  name later, with `as` or to the left of a colon.
* Do not end a proof with `Qed.`, except with `Goal`, for that may prevent later computations.
* Start all proofs with `Proof.` on a separate line and end it with
  `Defined.` on a separate line, as this makes it possible for us to generate
  HTML with expansible/collapsible proofs.
* Use Unicode notation freely, but make the parsing conventions uniform across files, and consider
  putting them into a scope.
* Each line should be limited to at most 100 (unicode) characters.  The
  makefile target `enforce-max-line-length` can be used to detect nonconforming
  files, and the target `show-long-lines` can be used to display the
  nonconforming lines.
* Always use Coq's proof structuring syntax ( ` { } + - * ` ) to focus on a
  single goal immediately after a tactic creates additional goals.
* Indentation should normally be that produced automatically by emacs' `coq-mode`.
* Within the core `Foundations` package:
  * Do not start lines with `:` or with `:=`.
  * One should normally put an extra blank line between units.  Exceptions may
    be made for closely related items.
* When using `abstract` in a proof, it is unsound to refer later by name to the
  abstracted lemma (whose name typically ends with `_subproof`), because
  its type may vary from one version of Coq to another.  Coq's current behavior is also
  unlikely to be duplicated precisely by a future proof assistant. 

Our files don't adhere yet to all of these conventions, but it's a goal we
strive for.

Another advantage of coding in this style is that the proofs should be easier
to transport to another proof assistant.

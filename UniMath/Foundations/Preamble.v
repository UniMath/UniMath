(** * Introduction. Vladimir Voevodsky . Feb. 2010 - Sep. 2011

This is the first in the group of files which contain the (current state of) the mathematical
library for the proof assistant Coq based on the Univalent Foundations.  It contains some new
notations for constructions defined in Coq.Init library as well as the definition of dependent sum.

(** Identity Types *)

Inductive paths {A:UU} (a:A) : A -> UU := paths_refl : paths a a.
Hint Resolve paths_refl : core .
Notation "a = b" := (paths a b) (at level 70, no associativity) : type_scope.
Notation idpath := paths_refl .

(* Remark: all of the uu0.v now uses only paths_rect and not the direct "match" construction
on paths. By adding a constantin paths for the computation rule for paths_rect and then making
both this constant and paths_rect itself opaque it is possible to check which of the
constructions of the uu0 can be done with the weakened version of the Martin-Lof Type Theory
that is interpreted by the Bezem-Coquand-Huber cubical set model of 2014. *)

(** Dependent sums.

One can not use a new record each time one needs it because the general theorems about this
construction would not apply to new instances of "Record" due to the "generativity" of inductive
definitions in Coq.

We use "Record", which is equivalent to "Structure", instead of "Inductive" here, so we can take
advantage of the "primitive projections" feature of Coq, which introduces η-reduction for pairs, by
adding the option "Set Primitive Projections".  It also speeds up compilation by 56 percent.

The terms produced by the "induction" tactic, when we define "total2" as a record, contain the
"match" construction instead appealing to the eliminator.  However, assuming the eliminator will be
justified mathematically, the way to justify the the "match" construction is to point out that it
can be regarded as an abbreviation for the eliminator that omits explicit mention of the first two
parameters (X:Type) and (Y:X->Type).

I.e., whenever you see

       [match w as t0 return TYPE with | tpair _ _ x y => BODY end]

in a proof term, just mentally replace it by

       [@total2_rect _ _ (λ t0, TYPE) (λ x y, BODY) w]

*)

Set Primitive Projections.
Set Nonrecursive Elimination Schemes.

Record total2 { T: UU } ( P: T -> UU ) := tpair { pr1 : T; pr2 : P pr1 }.

Notation "'∑'  x .. y , P" := (total2 (λ x, .. (total2 (λ y, P)) ..))
  (at level 200, x binder, y binder, right associativity) : type_scope.
  (* type this in emacs in agda-input method with \sum *)

Notation "x ,, y" := (tpair _ x y).

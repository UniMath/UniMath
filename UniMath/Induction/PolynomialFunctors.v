(** ** Polynomial functors

    Using the formalism of a polynomial functor, one can build any functor
    combining constant types, +, and ×, where the variable X is to the right
    of the arrow →.

    W-types are (up to isomorphism) initial algebras of polynomial functors,
    whereas M-types are final coalgebras.

**Composition in the second projection defines the behavior of arrows in a polynomial functor.**

The definition of a polynomial functor for two types X and Y, denoted as `polynomial_functor_arr {X Y}`, takes a function `f : X → Y` as input and returns a new type that encodes the composition of `f` with a polynomial evaluation on an object of type Y. The resulting type is defined as follows:

`(pr1 o, (f ∘ pr2 o)%functions)`, where `o` is a polynomial functor object for type X and `(f ∘ pr2 o)%functions` represents the function obtained by composing `f` with the polynomial evaluation on the second projection of `o`.

The `pr1` and `pr2` functions are projections that extract the first and second elements from a tuple, respectively. The `%functions` operator represents a type that encodes functions that map elements in one type to elements in another type. In this case, it is used to specify the type of the output of `(f ∘ pr2 o)%functions`.

In summary, this definition states that when given a polynomial functor object for type X and a function `f : X → Y`, we can define a new type that encodes the composition of `f` with a polynomial evaluation on an object of type Y by composing `f` with the polynomial evaluation on the second projection of the input object and applying the `%functions` operator to specify the output type.

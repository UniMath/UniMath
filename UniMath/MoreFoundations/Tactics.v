(** A version of "easy" specialized for the needs of UniMath.
This tactic is supposed to be simple and predictable. The goal
is to use it to finish of "trivial" goals *)
Ltac unimath_easy :=
  trivial; intros; solve
   [ repeat (solve [trivial | apply pathsinv0; trivial] || split)
   | match goal with | H : ∅ |- _ => induction H end
   | match goal with | H : ¬ _ |- _ => induction H; trivial end
   | match goal with | H : _ → ∅ |- _ => induction H; trivial end
   | match goal with | H : _ → _ → ∅ |- _ => induction H; trivial end ].

(** Override the Coq now tactic so that it uses unimath_easy instead *)
Tactic Notation "now" tactic(t) := t; unimath_easy.

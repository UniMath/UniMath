# Chains and ω-(co)continuous functors

This directory contains theory about ω-(co)ntinuous functors, i.e. functors which
preserve (co)limits of chains, which are diagrams of the form X₀ → X₁ → ⋯
([is_omega_cont] and [is_cont]). 

It also defines cochains, which are diagrams of the form X₀ ← X₁ ← ⋯.

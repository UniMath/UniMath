===========

This directory contains a development of limits on the basis of
descriptions of diagrams by functors (as in MacLane's CWM).

**Warning**: this file is mostly here for historical purposes. For a
more developed definition of (co)limits see
[limits/graphs](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/tree/master/UniMath/CategoryTheory/limits/graphs).

## Contents

* *limits.v*
  * cones given by a functor and a tip
  * pointwise constructions of limits in functor precategories

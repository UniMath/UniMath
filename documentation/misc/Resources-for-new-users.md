## Tutorials on the following topics
For exercises to practice all kinds of things, see the [Cortona course and other courses](https://github.com/UniMath/Schools).
* Category theory (displayed categories), univalence, (limits?)
* Working with `transportf`, and how to avoid it wherever possible. Lemmas like `transportf_set`, `transport_f_f`, `transpose_transportf`, `subtypePairEquality` (`subtypePath`), `idpath_transportf`, `transportf_const`, `functtransportf` and the applicability of custom lemmas.
* Not sure. But somewhere someone needs to mention that `setproperty` and `homset_property` can close a lot of goals.
* Introducing and eliminating paths, maybe? Like path induction, path inversion and composition, `total2_paths_f`, `base_paths`, `fiber_paths`, `maponpaths`, `split`
* (Weak) equivalences: `(is)weq_iso`, `invweq` and `invmap`, `homotweqinvweq`, `homotinvweqweq`, `weqcomp`, `isweqhomot`

# Setup - Installing UniMath and other software-related information

To install UniMath on your computer, there are two options:

- Install a released binary version of UniMath via the [Coq Platform](https://coq.inria.fr/download).
- To develop, and contribute to, UniMath, you should compile the latest version of UniMath yourself - see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

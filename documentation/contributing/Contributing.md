# Contributing

## What to contribute?
Potential work on the library is tracked in two ways. Firstly, there are the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/issues). These keep track of proofs, definitions, or refactorings that would make working with the UniMath library easier or better, or that are needed for further work. There is also the [Opportunities](./Opportunities.md) file, which tracks projects that would interesting to do, and are possible to do with the current state of the library, but are currently not necessary.

Feel free to take up a project from either the issues or opportunities file, or to add new issues or opportunities you think of.

## Pull Requests
The git and GitHub part of the contribution process, including forking, branching, and remote tracking, is documented on the page about [git and GitHub](Git-and-GitHub).

Before making a pull request:
- Check all your modified code compiles.
- Run the sanity checks with `make sanity-checks`.
- Make sure that your code adheres to the [Style guide](./Style-guide.md). In particular, to make sure that your code is usable down the road, make sure that your proofs and definitions have the correct [opaqueness](./../misc/On-opaqueness.md).
- If you have changed the file structure of the repository, for example by adding a new file, make sure you have followed the instructions below.

In the end, you will need someone from the [coordinating committee](../misc/About-UniMath.md#coordinating-committee) to merge your pull request into the main repository. Note that from then on, your code will be subject to the [copyright and license agreement](../../LICENSE.md).

## Foundations

Changes to the package "Foundations" are normally not accepted, for we are trying to keep it in a state close to what Vladimir Voevodsky originally intended. A warning is issued if you run `make` or `make all` and have changed a file in the Foundations package.

## Adding a file to a package
To add a file to a package, add its path to `.package/files`. Each package contains a subdirectory called `.package`, with one file called `files`. This consists of a list of the paths to the `*.v` files of the package, in order: A file is listed after files it depends on. This is done so the `TAGS` file will be correctly sequenced.

## Adding a new package
Create a subdirectory of this directory, populate it with your files, add a `README.md` file, and add a file `.package/files` as described in [Adding a file to a package](#adding-a-file-to-a-package). Then add the name of your package to the head of the list assigned to `PACKAGES` in the file [`Makefile`](../../Makefile).

Alternatively, if you would like to test your package without modifying the `Makefile`, add its name to the head of the list in [`build/Makefile-configuration`](../../build/Makefile-configuration), which is created from [`build/Makefile-configuration-template`](../../build/Makefile-configuration-template).

# Projects in UniMath

This page collects possible projects in UniMath that
- are well-specified
- can be done in a reasonable amount of time
- would be suitable for inclusion in UniMath/UniMath (or, possibly, in a satellite repository)
- possibly satisfy other criteria? (To be discussed.)

## Construction of the free category generated by a graph
- Could use an impredicative generation of the morphisms, or an inductive type (in the latter case, it would need to go into a satellite repository)
- Would be useful for connecting different definitions of (co)limit

## Proof that (co)limits commute with (co)limits
- Should, in the first instance, use (co)limits indexed by a category, not (co)limits indexed by a graph
- Special cases would also be useful (for instance, the case of colimits of cochains), but it is unclear if this is any easier than the general result

## Moggi semantics

Moggi semantics are a well-established way to interpret programming languages with side effects using category.

The goal of this project would be:
- Define the mono requirement (Definition 1.2 in [1])
- Define strong monads (Definition 3.2 in [1])
- Give examples of strong monads (Example 3.5 in [1])
- Define models of λc (Definition 3.9 in [1])
- Provide a shallow embedding of the rules of λc in arbitrary models (Tables 8-11 in [1])

## Markov Categories

Markov categories [1] give a synthetic way to study probability theory, and in particular, they can be used to give semantics for probabilistic programming languages [2]. For example, the notion of a deterministic morphism can be define internal to arbitrary Markov categories. 

The goal of this project would be:
⁃ Define the notion of Markov category (Definition 2.1 in [1], Definition 6.3 in [2]).
- Define affine monads (Definition 3.4 in [2])
- Define commutative monads (Definition 3.3 in [2]). Note: there are alternative definitions as well (Proposition 2.6 in [3])
- Show that the Kleisli category of an affine monad is a Markov category (Proposition 6.4 in [2]).
- Define deterministic morphisms in Markov categories (Definition 6.5 in [2])
- Define the representability condition for commutative and affine monads (Definition 6.8 in [2])
- Give instances of such monads (Proposition 6.10 in [2])
- Prove Proposition 6.9 in [2]

## Quantum theory

Recently, category theory has found applications in quantum theory/computation. Using the language of monoidal categories and dagger categories, one can describe concepts and prove theorems from quantum mechanics in an abstract way

The goal of this project would be:
- Define the category Rel of relations (Definition 0.5 in [1])
- Define the monoid of scalars in monoidal categories (Definition 2.1 in [1]), and prove multiplication of scalars in commutative (Lemma 2.3 in [1])
- Define dagger categories (Definition 2.32 in [1], Definitions 9.7.1 and 9.7.4 in [2])
- Define various notions of morphisms in dagger categories (Definition 2.34 in [1])
- Define monoidal dagger categories (Definition 2.37 in [1])
- Define superposition rules (Definition 2.12 in [1])
- Define dagger biproducts (Definition 2.39 in [1])
- Define complete sets of effects (Definition 2.50 in [1])
- Prove that Rel is a symmetric monoidal dagger category (Definition 2.33 in [1]) with a superposition rule and dagger biproducts
- Prove the Born rule (Proposition 2.55 in [1])

Representable Functors
======================

In this subdirectory is a unified approach to the notions of category theory
satisfying universal properties via representable functors.  The idea is that
uniqueness up to isomorphism of two objects satisfying the same universal
property should always be drawn as a direct corollary of the uniqueness of
representations of a representable functor.

These files were originally in the Ktheory package and were written by Dan
Grayson.

## Precategories.v

easy lemmas about precategories, could be moved up

## Representation.v

Representation.Data is a representation of a functor C ==> Set.  This is used
in other files for defining various limits and colimits.

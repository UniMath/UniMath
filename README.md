Univalent Mathematics
=====================

This Coq library aims to formalize a substantial body of mathematics using the
[univalent point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univalent_foundations).

Installation
------------

See
[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

Contents
--------

The [UniMath subdirectory](UniMath/) contains various packages of formalized
mathematics. For more information about its contents, see the `README` (or `README.md`) in each package.

Some scientific articles describing the contents of the UniMath library are listed in the 
[wiki](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/wiki/Documentation:-Articles-describing-UniMath).

Univalent Mathematics
=====================

This Coq library aims to formalize a substantial body of mathematics using the
[univalent point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univalent_foundations).

Installation
------------

See
[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

Contents
--------

The [UniMath subdirectory](UniMath/) contains various packages of formalized
mathematics. For more information, see the [UniMath Table of Contents](UniMath/CONTENTS.md).

Some scientific articles describing the contents of the UniMath library are listed in the 
[wiki](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/wiki/Documentation:-Articles-describing-UniMath).

Discussing UniMath & Getting Help
---------------------------------

- **Questions** about the UniMath library, compilation, and installation of UniMath, etc.,
should be sent to the [UniMath mailing list](mailto:univalent-mathematics@googlegroups.com), which is archived in the 
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/univalent-mathematics).
- **Bugs** should be reported in our [UniMath bug tracker on Github](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/issues).


Citing UniMath
--------------

To cite UniMath in your article, you can use the following bibtex item:
```bibtex
@Misc{UniMath,
   author = {Voevodsky, Vladimir and Ahrens, Benedikt and Grayson, Daniel and others},
   title = {{\em UniMath}: {Univalent} {Mathematics}},
   howpublished = {Available at \url{https://github.com/UniMath}}
}
```
Note that this requires ```\usepackage{url}``` or ```\usepackage{hyperref}```.


The UniMath Development Team
----------------------------

The UniMath project was started in 2014 by merging the repository
[Foundations](https://github.com/UniMath/Foundations), by Vladimir Voevodsky
(in 2010), with two repositories based on it:
[rezk_completion](https://github.com/benediktahrens/rezk_completion), by
Benedikt Ahrens, and [Ktheory](https://github.com/DanGrayson/Ktheory), by
Daniel Grayson.  Vladimir Voevodsky was a member of the team until his death in
September, 2017.

The current members of the UniMath Development Team are:

	- Benedikt Ahrens
	- Daniel Grayson

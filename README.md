# Univalent Mathematics

This [Rocq](https://coq.inria.fr/) library aims to formalize a substantial body of mathematics using the
[univalent point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univalent_foundations).

## Getting Help & Discussing UniMath

- For **questions** about the UniMath library and **requests** for **help** with installing or using the library, visit the [UniMath Zulip](https://unimath.zulipchat.com) (click [here](https://unimath.zulipchat.com/register/) to register).
- For **bugs** and **suggestions** about **improvements**, file an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/issues).

## Trying out UniMath

You can try out UniMath in the browser by clicking [here](https://unimath.github.io/live/).
For instance, you can run the files from the [School on Univalent Mathematics](https://unimath.github.io/Schools/) in the browser.

## Further documentation
